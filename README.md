# Bulk Image Optimize or Compress - Console Client


This project is based on https://github.com/madskristensen/ImageOptimizer by Mads Kristensen, which is basically Visual Studio Extension, 
which enables developers to optimize/compress images in Visual Studio IDE.

## Use case ##
This solution will allow you to bulk compress or optimize images inside any folder. You may have folder inside folder with images, this solution works for this case too.

Production Tested: I have used it to bulk compress images on production envirement. I noticed that Seqrite antivirus will prompt you to allow this software when you compressing, this is because it operates on files directly.
