# Bulnk Image Optimize or Compress - Console Client


This project is based on https://github.com/madskristensen/ImageOptimizer by Mads Kristensen, which is basically Visual Studio Extension, 
which enables developers to optimize/compress images in Visual Studio IDE.

## Use case ##
This extension works well, but what if you want to automate similar things, when user uploads image this should be trigger compression, 
or create azure function which runs this code to compress image uploaded on blob. 


This source code will help you achieve this.
